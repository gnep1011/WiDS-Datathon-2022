# WiDS-Datathon-2022

I participated in the WiDS Datathon 2022, which is a social impact challenge focusing on the environment and climate change.

The main goal is to use a dataset consisting of variables that describe building characteristics and climate and weather variables for the regions in which the buildings are located. Accurate predictions of energy consumption can help policymakers target retrofitting efforts to maximize emissions reductions.

This competition was held on Kaggle. Data source link as below:
